/**
 * Actions the top-level Toolbar can render on behalf of the current screen.
 *
 * Lets a screen (today: ChatScreen) publish its own callbacks up to the
 * shared Toolbar without the parent Scaffold having to know about them.
 * Mirrors the `LocalShowToolbarAvatar` pattern so the local is provided
 * above the Scaffold, and screens mutate the backing MutableState to
 * publish (or clear) their callbacks per lifecycle.
 *
 * When `onNewChat` is null the Toolbar hides the affordance entirely.
