# M1K3 launch site

Single-page launch site for M1K3 for Mac. Self-contained: THREE.js is vendored
in `vendor/` (from `src/web-avatar/node_modules`), the hero fox is a local GLB —
no CDN required for the 3D, fitting for a "no cloud attached" product. The only
external request is Google Fonts (degrades gracefully to system mono).

## Run

```bash
make site        # from repo root — serves + opens http://localhost:8002
# or: cd site && python3 -m http.server 8002
```

**Don't open index.html by double-clicking it.** Chrome blocks ES modules and
fetch over `file://` (unique-origin policy), so the 3D won't load. It must be
served over http. If the GLB still can't load, the hero falls back to a
procedural wireframe icosahedron.

## Hero

`vendor/Fox.glb` with a phosphor treatment (dark body + additive wireframe
shell). Idles on the `Survey` clip, takes a short `Walk` every ~11s, and `Run`s
when clicked. Camera has mouse parallax + scroll drift.
