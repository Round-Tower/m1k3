//  The WHAT I KNOW ABOUT YOU block: memory hits (kind .memory) are injected
//  as uncited personal facts between KNOWLEDGE and RULES. The first two tests
//  pin the no-memory output BYTE-IDENTICALLY to the pre-memory implementation
//  (captured verbatim 2026-06-12) — documents/calls/notes grounding must not
//  move by a single character.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.9, Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-13 — verbatim pins moved DELIBERATELY:
//  added an anti-fabrication RULE (both styles) and replaced the empty-grounding
//  "answer directly" licence with honest abstention, killing the off-store
//  confabulation (live sourdough/honey). The intent is also pinned by content
//  tests below so the wording can evolve without losing the guard.

        - Cite knowledge sources inline with citation tokens like \
        [Title §heading]; never invent citations.
        - Never present a fact, figure, or date you can't ground or verify \
        as certain; if you're unsure, say so plainly. Honesty beats a confident guess.
        - If a search or lookup comes back empty or fails, answer with explicit \
        uncertainty — name what you couldn't confirm — rather than presenting a guess as fact.
        - Use at most two tool calls, never repeating one with the same argument.
        - Questions about yourself — your configuration, design, or abilities — \
        are answered from your persona; never search stored documents for them.
        - For current or external information — weather, news, prices, \
        anything happening now — use web_search. search_knowledge only \
        finds documents already stored on this Mac.
        - web_search returns snippets AND automatically reads the \
        top result's page for you. Use fetch_page only to read a \
        DIFFERENT result in full, then conclude from the page text.
