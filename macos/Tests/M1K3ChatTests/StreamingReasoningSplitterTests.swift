//
//  The live counterpart to ReasoningSplit: routes streamed chunks to reasoning
//  vs answer AS THEY ARRIVE, so chain-of-thought renders in the disclosure in
//  real time instead of flashing raw <think> text in the bubble until the
//  stream ends. Pins tag-split-across-chunks handling, the lone-</think>
//  retro-move (Qwen3.5), and cumulative-snapshot normalisation (AFM).
