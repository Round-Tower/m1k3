//  Pins the final-utterance hygiene pass applied before a transcript reaches the
//  model: collapse pathological recognizer repetition, drop whole-utterance
//  silence-hallucinations ("Thank you" on a quiet mic), tidy whitespace. Returns
//  "" for an all-noise utterance so the caller's empty-guard parks the mic.
