//  Contract tests for the single-flight async loader — the pure concurrency
//  primitive behind "don't download the ~1GB MLX container twice". The old
//  MLXGemmaProvider used a check-then-act NSLock: read the cache under the lock,
//  release it, then do the slow load with no lock held — so two concurrent
//  callers (a Settings preload racing the first generate) both saw nil and both
//  loaded. This actor makes concurrent callers share ONE load by construction,
//  and it's Metal-free, so the race fix is provable under `swift test`.
