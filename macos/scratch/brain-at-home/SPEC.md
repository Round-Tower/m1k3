# Brain-at-Home — spec (scratch draft v1)

> iPhone in your pocket, brain on your Mac. The iOS shell discovers your Mac on
> the home network, pairs once, and streams from the Mac's MLX brain — so the
> phone gets Big-tier answers while everything stays inside your walls.

## 1. Product shape

- Phone Settings/brain picker gains a **"Home Mac"** tier: appears when a
  paired Mac is reachable, streams generation from it; the phone falls back to
  its own local brains (Mini/Lil) automatically when away. Local-first, always.
- Mac gets a **"Serve my brain to my devices"** toggle in the Privacy pane —
  default OFF (nil is a NO). ON = advertise + listen; OFF = listener down,
  advertisement gone, instantly.
- Pairing is a one-time ceremony: the Mac shows a QR; the phone scans it.
  Paired devices are listed in the Mac's Privacy pane with one-tap revoke.

## 2. The decisive scoping call: inference, not MCP

The phone uses the Mac as an **InferenceProvider** (prompt in → token stream
out), NOT as an MCP client. Rationale:

- `LocalMCPHTTPServer` is **loopback-pinned at the OS level**
  (`requiredLocalEndpoint = .loopback`, LocalMCPHTTPServer.swift:68) as the
  documented privacy story ("no LAN exposure, ever"). That pin is UNTOUCHED by
  this feature — widening the whole tool surface (search_knowledge,
  get_document, remember, forget…) to the LAN multiplies the attack surface
  for no v1 value.
- The phone already runs its own full agent loop, RAG, and memory locally
  (AppCore composes LocalAgent + HashingEmbeddingService + its own stores).
  What it lacks is a strong BRAIN. So the brain travels; the memories don't.
- Consequence, stated honestly: **phone corpus ≠ Mac corpus** in v1. "Ask my
  Mac's knowledge from my phone" is Phase D, a separate consent conversation.
- **Remote turns are brain-only — ZERO server-side tool execution (audit B1).**
  Tool-call syntax the Mac's brain emits streams back to the phone and is
  answered by the PHONE's own local tool registry, exactly as Mini/Lil do
  today. The Mac never executes a tool on behalf of a remote caller. If
  server-side execution is ever wanted, that is a different feature with its
  own threat table — not an extension of this one.
- **The v1 PSK is scoped to generate-only (audit N4).** Phase D requires a
  new, explicit per-device consent grant — never a silent widening of what an
  existing pairing unlocks.

## 3. Architecture

```
Mac                                        iPhone
───                                        ──────
BrainService (NEW, own port, default OFF)  RemoteMacBrainProvider (NEW)
 ├─ NWListener + TLS-PSK, Wi-Fi/Ethernet    ├─ conforms InferenceProvider
 │  interfaces ONLY (audit B3)              │  + ToolCallingProvider
 ├─ POST /v1/generate  (SSE token stream)   ├─ SSE streaming client (NEW —
 ├─ GET  /v1/health    (PSK-authed, B4)     │
 └─ serves the SAME loaded brain the        │  repo has no streaming HTTP yet)
    Mac app is using (no second load)       └─ drops into the existing
BrainAdvertiser (dnssd, gemba pattern)         SwappableInferenceProvider slot
 └─ _m1k3-brain._tcp + TXT {v, name}       BrainBrowser (NWBrowser,
MCP server: UNTOUCHED, loopback-only        gemba state-machine pattern,
                                            AsyncStream seam)
```

- **Separate listener, separate port, separate consent.** The MCP server's
  loopback pin and one-client model are never modified.
- **dnssd advertiser** (gemba's `DNSServiceRegister` pattern) — advertises
  without binding, so the BrainService's NWListener owns its port cleanly.
  TXT carries protocol version + display name ONLY — never secrets, never
  capability details that fingerprint the user.
- **No second model load**: BrainService generates through the app's live
  `SwappableInferenceProvider`/current brain. Single-flight with the Mac's own
  turns and **the Mac user wins by preemption (audit S2): a new local turn
  CANCELS any in-flight remote generation** (the phone sees a clean
  stream-interrupted error and retries/falls back local); remote requests
  otherwise queue or 429 with Retry-After. **Remote turns pass through the
  same `applyCoolHead` gate as local sends — a hard requirement, not a
  recommendation**: a paired device hammering Big-tier generations must never
  thermally starve the person at the Mac.
- **Interface pinning is a spike-A1 acceptance criterion (audit B3):** an
  unconstrained NWListener binds every non-loopback interface — including a
  Tailscale/VPN tunnel or Personal Hotspot — silently converting "LAN-only"
  into "wherever this device routes." Pin to Wi-Fi/Ethernet interface types
  AND reject non-RFC1918/link-local source addresses at accept time;
  A1 must demonstrate the port is unreachable over an active Tailscale.
- **Every route on this listener requires the PSK-authenticated session —
  no exceptions (audit B4).** An unauthenticated health endpoint would be a
  free LAN recon surface (owner name, brain, version) for any device with
  zero PSK knowledge. Discovery hinting lives in the TXT record and nowhere
  else.

## 4. Pairing & transport (the security core)

- **Trust = a 32-byte PSK, exchanged visually, never over the network.**
  Pairing: Mac generates a random 32-byte secret + displays it as a QR
  (payload: `m1k3-pair://v1?psk=…&name=…&port=…`). Phone scans with an
  **IN-APP scanner only (audit N1)** — never the system Camera app, which
  would leak the `m1k3-pair://` URL into Safari history/Spotlight/Handoff.
  No PAKE, no pairing network window, no code typing — the QR on the
  Mac's screen IS the secure channel (an attacker needs eyes on your screen).
- **The Mac confirms every pairing (audit B2 — prevention, not detection).**
  Completing a handshake against an uncommitted PSK does NOT pair: the Mac
  shows *"New device wants to pair: <name/model>. Approve?"* and nothing is
  written to the Keychain — and not one `/v1/generate` byte is served — until
  the human clicks Approve. This closes the fastest-handshake-wins race (a
  QR-relaying attacker beating the legitimate phone) and makes multi-device
  pairing sane later.
- **PSK identity is a random opaque per-pairing value (audit S1):** TLS 1.3
  sends the PSK *identity* in the cleartext ClientHello (RFC 8446 §4.2.11) —
  it must never be a device name or anything fingerprintable. Server-side
  lookup among N stored identities must be constant-time.
- **iOS Local Network permission is a first-class UX moment (audit S1):**
  `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` + `NSBonjourServices` allowlist are
  required for discovery to work at all and surface a system consent dialog —
  Phase C designs for it (calm copy, graceful denied-state), not around it.
- **TLS 1.3 with PSK cipher suites** (Network.framework
  `sec_protocol_options_add_pre_shared_key`) — the PSK gives mutual
  authentication AND encryption in one move: no certificates, no CA, no
  trust-on-first-use hole. A client without the PSK cannot complete the
  handshake; there is no plaintext or TLS-without-PSK fallback path.
- **Storage:** `KeychainKeyStore` on BOTH ends (service `app.m1k3`,
  `AfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`, never iCloud-synced). One PSK per paired
  device (Mac stores N identities; phone stores 1 per Mac).
- **Revoke:** deleting the device row deletes its PSK → next handshake fails,
  AND any currently-open connection under that identity is terminated
  immediately (audit S3 — "phone just got stolen" must not wait for the
  stream to end). Toggle OFF tears down the listener AND the advertisement.
- **Pairing screen auto-expires** (QR regenerates/away in ≤60 s; a stale
  screenshot of an expired QR is useless because the displayed secret is only
  committed to the Keychain when a device completes its first handshake —
  uncompleted candidates are discarded on expiry).

## 5. Threat model (v1, LAN-only)

| Threat | Answer |
|---|---|
| Passive LAN sniffing | TLS 1.3 PSK — no plaintext path exists |
| Active MitM / rogue "Mac" advertising | Phone only handshakes with its stored PSK; a rogue advertiser can't complete TLS. Discovery is untrusted UI hinting ONLY — never trust TXT/name for auth |
| Malicious LAN client | Can't handshake without PSK; pairing requires physical screen access; connection attempts rate-limited + logged to `securityLog` |
| Stolen QR (photo of screen) | Bounded by expiry + first-handshake commit (§4); paired-device list makes a ghost visible; revoke is one tap |
| Replay | TLS 1.3 handles transport replay; /v1/generate is stateless |
| DoS (hammering the port) | Per-IP handshake rate limit; listener is default-OFF and only up while the toggle is on |
| Prompt-injection via remote turns | The LITERALLY same responder instance + CanaryGuard + securityLog as local turns (Phase B acceptance criterion — not a parallel reimplementation; audit S4). AND stated honestly: CanaryGuard was built for content-borne injection; a remote caller can itself be the adversary (stolen PSK / compromised phone) — Phase B's auditor pass must adversarially prompt FROM the remote path. Canary storage → Keychain in Phase B (the MCPHostController.swift:52 widening is here) |
| Unauthenticated recon (health or any future route) | Every route requires the PSK session — no exceptions (audit B4). Discovery hinting lives in TXT only |
| Rogue advertiser reusing the Mac's display name | Can't authenticate — but surface it as a SIGNAL, not silence: "a device claiming to be your Mac failed to authenticate" (audit N2) |
| Repeated canary trips from one paired identity | Escalate: active notification + auto-revoke candidate, not a passive log line (audit N3) |
| WAN exposure | OUT OF SCOPE v1. No port-forwarding guidance, no relay. Interface pinning (B3) keeps an incidental VPN/hotspot from widening the boundary silently |

## 6. Concurrency & seams (house style)

- Pure state machines, tested first: `PairingState` (idle → displaying(secret,
  expiresAt) → committed(deviceID) | expired), `BrainBrowserState` (gemba's
  found/lost/browsing diff logic, modernised), `RemoteBrainAvailability`
  (reachable × paired × enabled → picker visibility).
- NW layer behind protocol seams surfacing **AsyncStream** (not @Observable
  mutation — the gemba divergence note): `BrainAdvertising`, `BrainBrowsing`,
  `BrainServing`, `SecretDisplaying`. Fakes drive the streams in tests; the
  NW concretes are verify-by-launch + a SelfTest loopback probe mode
  (M1K3_SELFTEST_BRAINSERVE=1: start listener with a test PSK, connect a
  client in-process, assert a token round-trip).
- `RemoteMacBrainProvider`: conforms `InferenceProvider` (4 reqs) +
  `ToolCallingProvider` via `StatelessToolTurnSession` (no remote KV
  assumptions in v1; the Mac's own persona-prefix/KV reuse still applies
  server-side). `isAvailable` = reachable ∧ paired ∧ enabled, cheap cached
  read refreshed by the browser stream.
- **Net-new hard bit:** an SSE/chunked streaming client (repo has zero
  streaming HTTP today — everything is buffered `.data(for:)`). Own spike.

## 7. Phasing

- **A — spikes (scratch, no ship):** (1) TLS-PSK NWListener⇄NWConnection echo
  on LAN incl. iPhone-to-Mac on real hardware — acceptance criteria include
  the NEGATIVE paths (audit S1/B3): no-PSK, wrong-PSK, and forced-TLS-1.2
  connections hard-fail with zero bytes returned; min TLS pinned to 1.3;
  constant-time server-side selection among N identities verified as API-
  supported; the port unreachable over an active Tailscale/VPN; (2) SSE
  streaming client with cancellation + backpressure; (3) dnssd advertise +
  NWBrowser round-trip (port gemba's pattern) incl. the iOS Local Network
  permission dance. Each spike has a RESULTS.md verdict gate.
- **B — Mac side:** BrainService + pairing UI (Privacy pane) + paired-device
  list/revoke + canary→Keychain migration + securityLog wiring. Full review
  loop + security-auditor pass on the REAL code.
- **C — iOS side:** browser + RemoteMacBrainProvider + "Home Mac" picker tier
  + away-fallback feel.
- **D — later, separate consent:** remote recall (a narrow, allowlisted
  read-only knowledge route — NOT the full MCP surface), multi-device
  politeness (queueing), Big-tier download hints.

## 8. Open questions (Kev)

1. Naming: "Home Mac" vs "M1K3 at home" vs the Mac's actual name in the picker.
2. Should the Mac show a live indicator while serving a phone turn (menu-bar
   glyph treatment = the honest-disclosure instinct says yes)?
3. Battery/thermal etiquette: do remote turns respect CoolHeadPolicy the same
   as local sends (recommend: yes, same `applyCoolHead` path, phone shows
   "your Mac is easing off")?
4. visionOS: same provider drops in — worth including in C, or iPhone first?

## 9. Security-auditor findings (2026-07-14 pass — ALL FOLDED above)

Blocking (resolved in-spec): **B1** tool-calling scope pinned brain-only,
phone-side registry (§2) · **B2** pairing requires an explicit on-Mac Approve
before commit — prevention over detection (§4) · **B3** interface pinning +
RFC1918 source check, Tailscale-unreachable as an A1 criterion (§3/§7) ·
**B4** every route PSK-authed, no unauthenticated health (§3/§5).
Should-fix (folded): **S1** negative-path A1 criteria, opaque constant-time
PSK identities, the iOS Local Network permission named (§4/§7) · **S2** local
turns preempt remote; CoolHead on remote turns is a hard requirement (§3) ·
**S3** revoke kills live connections (§4) · **S4** same-responder-instance as
a Phase B acceptance criterion + adversarial-remote-prompting test (§5).
Notes (folded): **N1** in-app QR scanner only (§4) · **N2** failed-auth
impersonation surfaces as a signal (§5) · **N3** canary-trip escalation (§5) ·
**N4** PSK scoped generate-only; Phase D = new consent grant (§2).
