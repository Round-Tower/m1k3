//
//  The pixel-face avatar as a full-bleed reactive backdrop once a conversation
//  is underway — the Mac's AvatarChatBackground brought to the phone. It blooms
//  when M1K3 is idle and recedes (dims, blurs, scales back) while an answer
//  streams or the user is composing, so the words always win. The reactive
//  decision is the pure, TDD'd ChatBackdropTreatment shared with the Mac; this
//  view only applies it. Non-interactive and hidden from VoiceOver, like its
//  Mac sibling.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-18, Confidence 0.8 (the treatment is
//  package-TDD'd; the full-bleed look, legibility, and bloom/recede feel on
//  device are verify-by-launch). Prior: none (new file, patterned on the Mac's
//  AvatarChatBackground.swift).
