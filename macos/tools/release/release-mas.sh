# release-mas.sh — build a Mac App Store .pkg for M1K3 (Apple Distribution +
# MAS entitlements + app-store-connect export). The direct .dmg path is
# release-macos.sh; this is the App Store channel.
#
# Differs from the direct build (release-macos.sh) in exactly three ways:
#   • signs with "Apple Distribution" (not Developer ID)
#   • CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS → M1K3-MAS.entitlements (no audioanalyticsd). This
#     now MATCHES project.yml's default (the default was inverted to MAS-safe on
#     2026-06-19 so no archive can leak the exception); the override is kept here
#     as belt-and-suspenders + self-documentation. release-macos.sh is the one
#     path that opts back INTO the full M1K3.entitlements.
#   • exports method=app-store-connect → a .pkg for App Store Connect upload
#
# Prereqs: a VALID "Apple Distribution: … (76DJH43A4P)" cert in the keychain,
# the Apple ID account configured in Xcode (for -allowProvisioningUpdates to
# register the App ID app.m1k3 + fetch a Mac App Store profile), and eventually
# an App Store Connect app record for the upload step (not needed to BUILD).
#
# bash 3.2-safe.
