"""Stage a licence-compliant cold archive of the pinned model weights.

This is item 2 of the weight supply-chain plan (the "braces"): a second home
for the exact bytes a pin points at, so a pin cannot be stranded if upstream
deletes or force-pushes a repo. See issue #75 and ADR 0002.

WHAT IT DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.

It stages — verifies every pinned file against `weights-manifest.json`, then
copies the exact bytes into a per-repo tree with the licence notices a
redistributor owes. It NEVER pushes without an explicit `--push-hf` flag and
credentials, because publishing bytes is an outward-facing act that is the
user's to authorise, not a script's. The default run stages, verifies, reports,
and prints the push commands, touching no remote.

The R2 half is print-only: neither `rclone` nor the `aws` CLI is installed on
this machine, and silently no-oping an upload would be worse than saying so.
The HuggingFace half can run end-to-end (`huggingface-cli` is present) once a
token and an org are supplied.

TRUST MODEL. It refuses to archive bytes that disagree with the manifest —
archiving a poisoned or stale file would defeat the whole point, so a mismatch
is a hard stop, never a warning. Same rule as `pin_weights.py`.

LICENCE POSITION (from the 2026-07-21 review; see MIRRORING_WEIGHTS.md and the
`gemma-4-is-apache-2` memory). All three pinned models are Apache-2.0, so
redistribution is permitted and the obligation is small: ship the LICENSE and
say what was modified. The catch is that `mlx-community/gemma-4-12B-it-4bit`
ships NO licence and NO attribution — so re-hosting it as-is would republish
that omission. This tool adds a LICENSE and a modification NOTICE to every
staged repo, which makes our copy strictly more compliant than the upstream we
took it from.

Usage:
    python3 macos/tools/weights/archive_weights.py                 # stage + verify + plan (no network)
    python3 macos/tools/weights/archive_weights.py --out DIR       # stage into DIR
    python3 macos/tools/weights/archive_weights.py --push-hf ORG    # also upload to hf.co/ORG/<repo> (needs a token)
