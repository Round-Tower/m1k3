"""Regenerate Sources/M1K3MLX/PinnedWeights.swift — the shipped weight manifest.

Why this is a script and not hand-typed hex: re-pinning happens every time a
brain is promoted (both tiers moved inside 26 hours in July 2026), and a
manifest is only worth anything if regenerating it is mechanical enough that
nobody is tempted to skip it.

TRUST MODEL — read before changing anything here.

The digests are computed from the LOCAL, already-downloaded snapshot by
default, NOT from HuggingFace's API. That is deliberate: the local copy is the
one that has actually been run and evaluated, so pinning it pins the bytes we
know behave correctly. HuggingFace's published LFS oid is then used as an
INDEPENDENT SECOND OPINION — if the two agree, two parties confirm the same
bytes, and a compromise would have to have happened before our evals to slip
through. A mismatch is a hard stop, never a warning.

Small files (config.json, chat_template.jinja, tokenizer_config.json) are not
LFS-backed, so HF publishes no content digest for them and only the local hash
is available. They are pinned anyway — the chat template in particular IS the
tool-calling contract for gemma, so a silent change there is a behaviour change
in disguise.

Usage:
    python3 macos/tools/weights/pin_weights.py                # verify + regenerate
    python3 macos/tools/weights/pin_weights.py --check        # verify only, exit 1 on drift

# The repos M1K3 actually ships and downloads for a user-selectable brain.

# Caches, embedder weights under Documents. Both flow through the same
# HubApiDownloader.download choke point, so both are enforceable.
