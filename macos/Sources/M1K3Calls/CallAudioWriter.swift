//  CallAudioWriter.swift
//  M1K3Calls
//
//  Write captured near/far mono channels to a validated stereo `.caf` — atomically.
//  The previous inline writer handed AVAudioFile an INTERLEAVED buffer that didn't
//  match the file's processingFormat, so every write produced ZERO frames: a
//  recording that "happened" but held no audio (the symptom behind "I recorded a
//  call and nothing appeared"). It also created the destination file BEFORE writing,
//  leaving an orphaned 0-frame `.caf` whenever a write failed.
//
//  This fills a NON-interleaved buffer in the file's own processingFormat (the .caf
//  on disk is still interleaved — AVAudioFile converts on write), writes to a
//  `.partial` sibling, confirms real frames, then atomically renames into place. A
//  `defer` removes the partial on every failure path, so the only file that ever
//  appears is a real recording. Channels are filled directly here — no interleaver.
