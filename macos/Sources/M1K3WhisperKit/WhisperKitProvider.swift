//  M1K3WhisperKit
//
//  High-accuracy on-device transcription via WhisperKit (CoreML). Isolated in
//  its own target — like M1K3MLX — so only this target and the app link the heavy
//  CoreML/model machinery; M1K3Voice stays system-frameworks-only.
//
//  WhisperKit needs a model downloaded + loaded before it can serve, so
//  `isAvailable` is false until `prepareModel` succeeds — which means the router
//  uses Apple Speech out of the box and switches to WhisperKit once its model is
//  ready. Live mic streaming runs through WhisperKit's `AudioStreamTranscriber`,
//  whose `currentText` is cumulative (matching TranscriptAccumulator's fold).
//
//  Verify-by-launch: model download + mic streaming need a real device + the mic
//  entitlement; the seam it plugs into (router, accumulator) is unit-tested.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-06, Confidence 0.6,
//  Prior: internal call-pipeline project, WhisperKitProvider (Kev) — re-pointed at M1K3's live
//  TranscriptionProvider seam + AudioStreamTranscriber (the prior call-pipeline's was buffer-pump),
//  ModelManaged/PowerEfficiency surface dropped.
//  Review: claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-09 — single-flight the model load through
//  SingleFlightLoader to kill the same check-then-act double-download race as the
//  batch transcriber. Confidence 0.8.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-16 (concurrency deep pass, findings
//  2/13/14/19) — restart races closed STRUCTURALLY. The root cause was that every
//  AudioStreamTranscriber wrapped the SAME `kit.audioProcessor` (one shared engine
//  slot), so any streamer's `stopStreamTranscription()` tore down whichever
//  session currently held the mic — a fire-and-forget old-stop could kill the new
//  session's capture, and a stale callback could kill a live successor. An
//  adversarial verify pass (3 lenses) showed a generation-guard + "belt" could not
//  make the shared processor safe. Fix: each session builds its OWN
//  `AudioProcessor()` (the constructor already accepts one), so `stopRecording()`
//  is session-scoped and cross-session capture damage is impossible. Generation
//  stamping remains for the SHARED transcript state (a stale onState must not write
//  `lastText` — which the next session's stop emits as its final segment, the
//  "previous utterance re-sent as a fresh turn" bug — nor finish a successor's
//  continuation) AND now drives a per-session SELF-STOP: `startStreamTranscription`
//  suspends at an XPC mic-permission hop on EVERY start (not just first launch), so a
//  stop landing in that window spends the provider's one fire-and-forget teardown on
//  a not-yet-armed engine, and the session would then record FOREVER (hot mic to app
//  quit + unbounded audio buffer) with no reference left to stop it. Fix: the first
//  state callback after the engine arms re-checks generation FIRST — before the
//  empty-text guard, so the placeholder-text zombie is caught — and self-stops its
//  OWN streamer, safe precisely because each session owns its processor. A 2-round
//  adversarial verify pass (6 lenses) drove this: the self-stop belt was WRONG on the
//  shared processor (it killed live successors) and CORRECT on the per-session one.
//  Verify-by-launch per this file's header. Confidence 0.8 — three adversarial-verify
//  rounds, not launch-tested; upstream WhisperKit timing taken on faith per the
//  metallib-wall convention. Evidence in macos/scratch/voice-session-audit-2026-07-16/.
