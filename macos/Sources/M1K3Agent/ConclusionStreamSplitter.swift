//  ConclusionStreamSplitter.swift
//  M1K3Agent
//
//  Buffers a streamed thought until the CONCLUSION: marker appears, then
//  passes everything after it through live — this is why the agent's final
//  answer streams token-by-token instead of arriving as one dump, without an
//  extra generation pass.
//
//  Handles both provider stream contracts (cumulative snapshots à la Apple
//  Foundation Models, and plain deltas) with the same normalise-to-delta rule
//  as ChatSession.fold, and a marker split across token boundaries.
//
//  Scaffolding guard: a model that writes "CONCLUSION: … ACTION: …" would
//  otherwise stream raw ReAct scaffolding to the user (seen live at ⌘R, the
//  Boston-weather bug). Emission is therefore cut at any ACTION: marker, with
//  a small holdback window so a marker split across chunks is still caught —
//  call `flush()` after the stream ends to release the held-back tail.
