//
//  Phase 17a — the dedicated chat-egress consent (the wall before the door).
//
//  The EscalationLadder's `networkAllowed` gate was provisionally sourced from
//  the web-search toggle — which defaults ON and governs a DIFFERENT egress
//  category (web tools fetching pages, not chat leaving the device). Sending a
//  conversation to a network model is the one thing M1K3's signed promise says
//  doesn't happen without explicit consent, so it gets its own key with the
//  opposite default: OFF until the user says otherwise, and an absent value is
//  a NO — consent is given, never assumed and never inherited from another
//  setting.
//
//  Deliberately no UI in 17a: with no network rung wired on macOS 26, a toggle
//  would be a dead control. The consent surface ships WITH the PCC rung (17b,
//  M1K3_FM27). Until then this key simply makes the ladder's gate honest.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-08, Confidence 0.9 (pure, total,
//  test-pinned; the default-OFF semantics are the point — challenger finding
//  on the default-ON proxy folded, PLAN.md Phase 17). Prior: Unknown
