//  M1K3LanguageModel
//
//  "Cool Head" — M1K3 respects the machine it runs on. Under thermal or power
//  pressure it caps EFFORT (agent-loop iterations, background work) and, at the
//  extreme, defers heavy generation with an honest message. It deliberately does
//  NOT swap the user's chosen brain: the brain is an identity choice ("Lil M1K3"),
//  a swap is a full model reload that dumps the KV + persona-prefix caches, and
//  auto-demoting the proud MLX brain to the weaker AFM both costs more and breaks
//  trust. Capping effort is the cheap, coherent, mid-conversation-safe lever
//  (LocalAgent.maxIterations is already just an Int).
//
//  Pure + off-device testable (mirrors EscalationLadder / GlyphTreatment). The
//  ProcessInfo.thermalState / isLowPowerModeEnabled reads and the maxIterations
//  wiring are verify-by-launch — thermal state can't be faked in a unit test.
//
//  Two design constraints, both from a challenger pass:
//   1. HYSTERESIS is mandatory. Degrade immediately (safety) but recover only
//      after a sustained relief streak — a bouncing thermalState would otherwise
//      flip effort every turn, and recovery-then-degrade is the worst case under
//      load. `next` enforces this; the caller threads the state per turn.
//   2. No Signal-B (throughput) yet. tok/s is MLX-only, log-only, and a warm/cold
//      baseline swamp; it targets dev-process contention, not real users. Thermal
//      + low-power cover the genuine "laptop on the knees" case. Fast-follow if
//      on-device logs prove thermal alone misses real-user contention.
//
//  Signed: claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-20, Confidence 0.85 (pure policy TDD'd;
//  challenger-scoped to effort-capping not brain-swapping; wiring + on-device
//  thermal behaviour are the named verify-owed). Prior: Unknown.
