//  ModelCacheIntegrity.swift
//  M1K3MLX
//
//  The pre-load tripwire for a TORN model directory. On 2026-07-16 a load of a
//  partially-written cache dir (weights index promising shards the files
//  didn't back) reached mlx-swift's quantize pass, whose Module.update runs in
//  a non-throwing context — the thrown UpdateError became swift_unexpectedError
//  and took the WHOLE APP down (Quantized.swift:126 → Module.swift:598). The
//  loader cannot be taught to throw from our side, so the defence is upstream
//  of it: verify the directory BEFORE loadContainer, and treat torn state as
//  "delete and let HubApi re-download", never as a crash.
//
//  Deliberately narrow: only the states that actually reach the crashing path
//  count as torn (index references a missing or zero-byte shard; a zero-byte
//  safetensors). Resumable `.incomplete` partials under .cache are NOT torn —
//  HubApi resumes those legitimately. A directory with no weights at all is
//  .empty (the normal pre-download state). No-index-but-weights is .ok — a
//  single-file model without an index cannot be validated, and blocking it
//  would regress legacy caches.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-16, Confidence 0.85 (the torn→crash
//  chain is stack-trace-evidenced; the verdict rules are pure and pinned; the
//  delete-then-redownload recovery is verify-by-launch). Prior: Unknown
