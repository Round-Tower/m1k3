//
//  WeightImport.swift
//  M1K3MLX
//
//  Lets a user who already has the weights on disk ("I already downloaded
//  these") hand them to M1K3 without a re-download — safely, because the
//  digests pinned in PinnedWeights.swift do not care where the bytes came
//  from. Verifying an arbitrary folder against the manifest is exactly as
//  rigorous as verifying a HubApi download: same manifest, same hashing
//  (`WeightIntegrityScan.observe`), same verdict core (`WeightIntegrity.
//  verdict`). Nothing here reimplements either.
//
//  ⚠️ ASYMMETRIC WITH THE DOWNLOAD PATH, ON PURPOSE. `WeightIntegrityScan.
//  enforce` treats an unpinned repo as `.unpinned` and lets it through — that
//  permissiveness exists so eval A/B overrides and spike checkpoints stay
//  loadable; pinning protects what we SHIP, not an allowlist of everything
//  loadable. Import gets no such carve-out: a download at least came from the
//  host we asked for (main-branch drift notwithstanding), but an imported
//  folder is bytes from anywhere the user's Finder can reach, with zero
//  provenance. Without a pin there is nothing to check those bytes against,
//  so importing an unpinned repo is refused outright rather than waved
//  through unverified.
//
//  THE METADATA WRITE IS THE WHOLE POINT, not a nicety. Copying verified
//  bytes into the cache and stopping there would BE the 2026-07-16 pre-seed
//  incident again: `HubFileDownloader.download` (swift-transformers'
//  HubApi.swift) decides whether to skip a file by reading
//  `<dir>/.cache/huggingface/download/<file>.metadata`, and a copy with no
//  metadata reads as a copy HubApi has never seen — the NEXT launch
//  re-downloads everything, worse than useless, which is exactly what
//  happened when the app's cache was pre-seeded with the CLI's own metadata
//  layout instead of HubApi's. `HubApi.writeDownloadMetadata` is called
//  directly here rather than reimplemented, so the on-disk format can never
//  drift from what `readDownloadMetadata` actually accepts. `pin.revision`
//  is true as the commit hash — these bytes were just proven to match that
//  exact revision — and the pinned sha256 is true as the etag for the files
//  that matter (the multi-GB LFS shards; `HubFileDownloader.download`
//  confirms an LFS etag by hashing the local file and comparing, which is
//  precisely the check these bytes already passed).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-07-21, Confidence 0.85 (every
//  behaviour in the header is test-pinned against a real filesystem,
//  including a direct read-back through HubApi's OWN `readDownloadMetadata`
//  rather than trusting our own string-splitting; the atomic-install failure
//  path is exercised directly. Honest caveat: this is verify-by-launch like
//  everything else that touches HubApi's on-disk layout — no test here
//  drives an actual `HubApiDownloader.download` call against an imported
//  directory to confirm it skips the network, because that needs a live
//  network call this suite deliberately never makes). Prior: Unknown
