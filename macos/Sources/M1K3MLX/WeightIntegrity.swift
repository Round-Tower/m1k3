//
//  WeightIntegrity.swift
//  M1K3MLX
//
//  Supply-chain tripwire for downloaded model weights. Every brain M1K3 runs
//  is fetched at runtime from a third-party host (HuggingFace), and until this
//  file existed we fetched `main` — whatever that pointed at, whenever the
//  user happened to onboard — and handed the bytes straight to MLX. A bad day
//  upstream (host compromise, a hijacked org account, a force-pushed repo)
//  meant arbitrary weights executing on the user's machine with no tripwire.
//
//  The defence is two-part and both parts are needed:
//    1. PIN A REVISION, so "what we ship" stops being a moving target. Note
//       this also turns a real, already-observed behaviour into an explicit
//       one: upstream repos change under us (the 2026-07-09 gemma chat-template
//       fix was expected to arrive purely via a weights re-pull, with no code
//       change and no review on our side). Pinning makes that a decision.
//    2. VERIFY THE BYTES against digests committed to THIS repo. Fetching the
//       expected hash from the same host that serves the file proves nothing —
//       whoever can swap the file can swap its published hash. The manifest
//       must travel with our source, signed and reviewed, or it is theatre.
//
//  ⚠️ The verdicts are deliberately NOT symmetric with ModelCacheIntegrity's,
//  and the difference is the point. A TORN cache is an accident, so it heals
//  silently: delete, re-download, carry on. TAMPERING is not an accident, so
//  it must NEVER auto-heal — silently re-fetching from the same poisoned
//  source would spin an infinite re-download loop that hides an active attack
//  behind what looks like flaky networking. Tampering refuses, loudly, and
//  the error is deliberately not retryable (`withRetry`'s default
//  `isTransientNetworkError` won't match it, so the load fails to
//  `AppReadiness.failed` instead of looping).
//
//  The other asymmetry that matters: an ABSENT pinned file is NOT tampering.
//  Mid-download, most files are absent — that is the overwhelmingly common
//  case, and treating it as an attack would alarm on every first run. Absent
//  is `.incomplete`; present-but-wrong is `.tampered`.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-07-21, Confidence 0.9 (the verdict
//  rules are pure and exhaustively pinned; the shipped manifest's digests were
//  computed from the on-disk snapshots that produced the 2026-07-15/16 eval
//  results AND independently agree with HuggingFace's published LFS oids for
//  all five large files — two parties confirming the same bytes). Honest
//  caveat: the refuse-on-tamper path is verify-by-launch like every MLX path
//  here, and pinning is bootstrapped from bytes we already trusted, which is
//  the irreducible trust-on-first-use step every pinning scheme has.
//  Prior: Unknown
