//  Pure display-mapping for the Advanced pane's "Import weights from a
//  folder…" affordance. Two seams, both worth pinning without a filesystem
//  or a running app:
//
//    1. Which tiers even offer an import — Mini is Apple Foundation Models
//       (no `mlxModelID`, nothing on disk to point at), so it must never
//       appear in the picker. Getting this wrong silently offers an import
//       for a tier that can't use one.
//    2. How a `WeightImport.Outcome` (success) or the errors it can throw
//       (failure) read on screen. The errors' `description`s were written
//       deliberately (WeightImport.swift / WeightIntegrity.swift headers) —
//       this file surfaces them VERBATIM, never paraphrases. Three TYPED
//       overloads, not one generic `Error`-taking function — see the big
//       comment on `outcome(for: WeightImportError)` below for why a
//       generic `as? any CustomStringConvertible` cast is a Darwin trap
//       here (it always succeeds, even for a stranger `NSError`).
//
//  The view (AdvancedSettingsPane) is a thin switch over `Outcome` — no
//  string-building, no error-type matching, lives here instead where
//  swift-testing can pin it.
//

//  test-pinned, including the typed-overload-vs-cast landmine, caught by a

//  Honest caveat: the copy itself ("won't re-download") is a judgement
//  call, not derived from anything — reasonable wording, not a spec.
