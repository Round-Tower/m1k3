//
//  One headless turn through a RAGResponding for callers that aren't the
//  chat UI — today the MCP `ask_m1k3` tool. Mirrors ChatSession.send's
//  post-processing contract (fold → reasoning split → citation validation →
//  polish → merged sources) without touching any transcript: the caller owns
//  conversation state, M1K3's chat history is never written.
//
//  Run this on a DEDICATED responder instance, not the chat UI's —
//  collectedSources() is a draining read and would race a live turn.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-11, Confidence 0.9 (contract
//  test-pinned against delta/cumulative/reasoning/citation fakes).
//  Prior: the MCP test report 2026-06-11 (F5).
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.9 — exclude
//  `.memory` hits from the Sources footer (they're "do not cite" ambient
//  context; a promiscuous short-fact embedding was rendering as a citation
//  source for unrelated queries). Validator allow-list unchanged.
