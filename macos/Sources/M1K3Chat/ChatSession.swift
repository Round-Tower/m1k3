//
//  The chat state the SwiftUI shell binds to. @MainActor + @Observable so views
//  observe `messages`/`isResponding` directly; all mutation is main-actor hopped,
//  which is also where SwiftUI wants its updates. The logic that actually carries
//  bugs — folding a streamed answer into displayable state — lives here under
//  test, not in a View, so the shell stays dumb (per the app-shell plan).
//
//  Streaming normalisation: the InferenceProvider contract is "cumulative-or-delta
//  (backend-defined)". Apple Foundation Models yields cumulative snapshots; the
//  lighter providers yield deltas. `fold` detects which per-chunk — if the chunk
//  extends what we have (`hasPrefix`), it's a snapshot and replaces; otherwise
//  it's a delta and appends. One reducer renders both correctly.

//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-30, Confidence 0.85 — distillation
//  gained a ROLLING trigger (was exit/launch only, "never per turn"). Once the
//  undistilled backlog outgrows the live HistoryWindow it distils mid-session, so
//  a long live conversation's early turns become retrievable facts before they
//  fall out of context — the other half of the context-headroom work. The
//  isResponding guard moved to the exit/launch path; the rolling path runs at
//  end-of-send (streaming done) so it can't contend with a live response.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-16, Confidence 0.85 (concurrency deep
//  pass, findings 25/30) — persistActiveConversation no longer runs the
//  O(conversation) JSON encode + SQLite write ON the MainActor at the end of
//  every send. It now calls a NEW `ChatHistoryPersisting.saveAsync`, which the
//  GRDB store implements with a native `dbQueue.write { }` (encode + write on the
//  DB's own queue — the codebase precedent in MemoryStore/KnowledgeStore), AWAITED
//  inline so every persistence invariant holds (row present when send returns,
//  ordering, no delete-resurrection under the isResponding guard). The synchronous
//  `save` is KEPT: it is driven by the one-time TranscriptMigrator inside
//  AppEnvironment's SYNCHRONOUS init(), so async-ifying it would have forced init()
//  async (a composition-root ripple into a parked-WIP file). A protocol-default
//  saveAsync hops the sync save off-caller for the non-GRDB conformers; a
//  Thread.isMainThread probe pins the default off-main. Named residual: a
//  DatabaseQueue serialises reads with writes, so the unguarded History-drawer read
//  can still block main behind a write (narrower than the original; full fix is a
//  DatabasePool/WAL split). switchTo's decode + init restore stay sync (follow-ups).
