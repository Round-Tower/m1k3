//
//  Reasoning models emit their chain-of-thought before the answer, in one of two
//  formats we know about:
//    • Qwen3 and friends: `<think>…</think>`
//    • gemma-4 (Big): `<|channel>thought … <channel|>` (asymmetric markers — the
//      pipe flips sides; its chat_template's strip_thinking macro removes exactly
//      this). Without this the whole thought channel leaks into the bubble.
//  We separate the reasoning from the answer so the bubble shows a clean reply
//  while the thinking is surfaced one tap away — transparency without clutter.
//
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-13, Confidence 0.9 — generalised from a
//  single `<think>` pair to a set of open/close tag pairs to also strip gemma-4's
//  channel-format reasoning (Big leaked its full thought trace into the UI).
//  Prior: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-10 (this file)
