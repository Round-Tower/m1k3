//  Distilled facts → memory items, deduped twice on the way in:
//  1. EXACT — sourceRef = sha256 of the normalized fact; DocumentIngester
//     already no-ops on an existing sourceRef, so the same fact re-distilled
//     across sessions collapses to one row for free, forever.
//  2. SEMANTIC — embed the fact, vector-search stored memories, skip when a
//     near-duplicate (cosine ≥ 0.90) already exists. Catches paraphrases the
//     hash can't ("Kev's sister is Aoife" / "Aoife is Kev's sister").
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.85 (mechanism
//  test-pinned; the 0.90 dedupe bar is an empirical starting point —
//  refine from MEMEVAL self-similarity stats if it over/under-merges).
