//  Copies a user-picked image into the app's own attachments directory before
//  a send, so the `ImageAttachment` URL the transcript persists survives
//  relaunches and never points at a sandbox-scoped original the app can't
//  reopen (a security-scoped picker URL is only readable inside the picker's
//  access window). UUID filenames keep repeated sends of the same file
//  distinct; the original's extension is preserved because type sniffing
//  downstream (the VLM processor / QuickLook thumbnails) reads it.
