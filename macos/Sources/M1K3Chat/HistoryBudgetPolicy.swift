//  Brain-aware sizing for the conversation replay (the long-context work). The
//  per-message text replay (HistoryWindow) is correct-by-construction — nothing
//  to invalidate — but how WIDE it can safely go is a per-tier fact, not a knob:
//    • dense Qwen3 (lil) holds a ~32K window in an unbounded KVCacheSimple —
//      a wide replay costs memory, never truncates.
//    • gemma-4-12B (big) holds a HARD RotatingKVCache(maxSize: 8192) — a prompt
//      over the window silently rotates the persona/grounding HEAD out during
//      prefill, answering off-persona and ungrounded with NO error. So `big`
//      MUST be clamped below 8192 (with margin for the char≈token estimate).
//
//  This pure policy turns a tier + the fixed-prompt reserve into a
//  `HistoryWindow.Budget`. It keeps `perTurnChars ≤ totalChars` so the rendered
//  block is provably ≤ totalChars (the rotating-KV clamp invariant), and caps the
//  replay at a latency ceiling so re-prefill cost stays bounded (replay prefill
//  does not amortize — the honest tradeoff for skipping KV persistence).
//
//  The char≈token ratio is a heuristic (the safety net is the conservative ratio
//  + the rotating margin + the on-device SelfTest verify that gemma's head never
//  rotates). Tune `charsPerToken`/`defaultLatencyCeilingTokens` from the ttft-log
//  token counts — the named [SPIKE].
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-30, Confidence 0.8 (the gemma-8192
//  clamp invariant is TDD-pinned; the real-token guarantee for dense/URL text is
//  the verify-owed the margin hedges). Prior: the long-context design memo.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-02, Confidence 0.85 — added
//  rotatingGenerationTokenCap + generationTokenCap(for:): the budget above
//  bounds PREFILL only, so the live provider's DECODE must be capped to the
//  same figure the budget reserves (the uncapped 4096 default crossed gemma's
//  window mid-answer and silently rotated the persona head out — the #112
//  review blocker). perTurn/maxTurns now reference HistoryWindow's constants
//  (one home, no silent divergence). Review-debt paydown: #112-1, #112-3.
