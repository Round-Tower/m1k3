//  MemoryDistiller.swift
//  M1K3Chat
//
//  The distillation core: turn a finished conversation slice into 0-N durable
//  facts about the user. Prompt + parser + normalizer are pure (TDD'd); the
//  ProviderMemoryDistiller orchestrates AFM-first with an MLX fallback (the
//  SummarizationPipeline two-tier shape, sequential because one output is
//  consumed, not two).
//
//  Output contract is line-based — "FACT(<kind>): <one sentence>" or exactly
//  "NONE" — because small local models fumble JSON (CallSummaryParser
//  precedent) and FACT: lines parse with zero ambiguity. The parser is the
//  defence layer: whatever persona-flavoured chatter a model emits, only FACT
//  lines survive, and any malformed/unknown kind label degrades to `.note`,
//  never to a dropped fact.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.85 (pure cores
//  tested; real-model fact quality is verify-at-⌘R). Prior: Unknown
//
//  Review (2026-07-08, Kev + claude-fable-5): the distiller now CLASSIFIES —
//  facts carry a DistilledFactKind (profile/preference/decision/episode/note)
//  parsed from a FACT(<kind>): label, closing the "both write paths tag .note"
//  TODO: on MemoryKind. Bare FACT: lines still parse (kind = .note), so a model
//  that ignores the new label loses nothing. Kev's product call, 2026-07-08.
