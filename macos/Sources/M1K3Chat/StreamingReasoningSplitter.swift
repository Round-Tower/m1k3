//
//  StreamingReasoningSplitter.swift
//  M1K3Chat
//
//  The live counterpart to ReasoningSplit: routes streamed chunks to reasoning
//  vs answer AS THEY ARRIVE, so a reasoning model's chain-of-thought renders in
//  the disclosure in real time — the user sees the model working within a
//  second instead of staring at a silent bubble for the whole think phase.
//
//  Handles both provider stream contracts (cumulative snapshots à la Apple
//  Foundation Models, plain deltas from MLX) with the same normalise-to-delta
//  rule as ChatSession.fold, tags split across chunk boundaries (a small
//  holdback window, same trick as ConclusionStreamSplitter), and Qwen3.5's
//  lone `</think>` (the template pre-opens the tag) via a retro-move of the
//  accumulated text into reasoning. The post-stream ReasoningSplit over `raw`
//  remains the final authority; this struct only drives the live rendering.
