//  Per-turn reasoning budget: Qwen3.5's think phase is gold on hard questions
//  and a 30-second tax on "yo, what's up?". Auto mode decides from cheap
//  signals — grounding present, analytic verbs, length — and the Settings
//  override (Always think / Fast answers) always wins. Fast turns render
//  no reasoning disclosure at all, honestly: nothing was thought.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-10, Confidence 0.8 (heuristic is a
//  starting point — tune on real turns). Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-29, Confidence 0.85 — the per-tier
//  fast default (df73a25a) removed only the "grounded ⇒ think" trigger, so the
//  broad substring markers ("how"/"why") and the 12-word length fallback still
//  fired thinking on nearly every UI message — "fast" was a lie and codegen
//  ("write"/"code") forced a think phase that ate the token budget the artifact
//  needs (the "refuses to code" bug). Fix: generation verbs are no longer
//  "analytic" on any tier, and the speed tier now thinks ONLY on an explicit
//  deep-reasoning marker (no weak openers, no length). Verify-by-feel at ⌘R.
