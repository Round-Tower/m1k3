//
//  ChatSession+Conversations.swift
//  M1K3Chat
//
//  Conversation management: the history drawer's surface. Cross-file
//  same-module extension (ChatSession.swift stays focused on the streaming
//  reducer); state mutations route through the main class's internal members.
//
//  Every entry point is guarded by `isResponding` — a turn in flight owns the
//  transcript. Empty conversations are never persisted (lazy rows), so
//  "New chat" twice in a row costs nothing and lists nothing.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-11, Confidence 0.9 (every transition
//  and guard test-pinned incl. the title/switch race). Prior: Unknown.
