//
//  Fixtures + pure report for the KEYWORD-QUERY GAP instrument
//  (M1K3_SELFTEST_KEYEVAL). Measured live 2026-07-08: full natural-language
//  QUESTIONS hit their target memory at rank #1 while bare KEYWORD queries
//  ("Golden Gate milestone") drift below the retrieval floors — the
//  no-instruct-prefix qwen3 embedder is symmetric, so keyword-string↔prose
//  under-aligns. The candidate fix is Qwen3-Embedding's official asymmetric
//  query instruction (`EmbeddingText.forQuery`); this harness measures BOTH
//  arms (bare vs instructed query) against the same production-composed
//  targets in one run, so the floor decision is derived from data, not vibes.
//
//  Two-sided by design (the challenger's flip): an instruction can lift NOISE
//  cosines as much as signal, and the memory floor's lowest true positive sat
//  0.003 above the bar — so the report always shows the noise ceiling and the
//  pooled positive floor together, per arm. "Floors unchanged" is the outcome
//  that needs justifying, not the default.
//
//  Fixtures + formatter are pure (unit-tested); the embedding pass is
//  verify-by-launch (metallib wall).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-09, Confidence 0.85 (probe set seeded
//  from the live 07-08 misses + keyword-ified MEMEVAL positives; extend as
//  real keyword misses surface). Prior: Unknown
