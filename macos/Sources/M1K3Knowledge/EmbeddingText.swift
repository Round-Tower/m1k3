//  B5 layer 3 — what a chunk is embedded AS. A chunk's discriminating context
//  often lives in the document TITLE ("Golden Gate derisk") while the body is
//  generic; embedding bare content left that context invisible to the vector
//  (the milestone memory measured 0.286 against its own query — under every
//  floor). Chunks now embed title-prefixed, at ingest AND reindex, through
//  this one composition point.
//
//  Two rules keep it honest:
//  - Content that already LEADS with its title (memory facts are their own
//    titles, including the word-boundary "…" truncation) embeds bare — no
//    doubled text shifting the fact lane.
//  - The composition is versioned into the store fingerprint, so changing it
//    triggers the same one-time corpus re-embed an embedder swap does; mixed
//    composition in one store would compare incompatible vectors forever.
//
//  Queries embed as typed (asymmetric on purpose): the title is document-side
//  context, not something a user would type twice.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-08, Confidence 0.85 (composition
//  pinned by tests; the retrieval delta + ABSEP/MEMEVAL threshold re-check is
//  the named on-device verify — layer 3's doctrine is measured, not guessed).
//  Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-09 — added `forQuery`, the
//  Qwen3-Embedding asymmetric query instruction (measurement-first: KEYEVAL
//  measures it before any call site adopts it). Doc-side composition and the
//  fingerprint salt are untouched. Confidence 0.85.
