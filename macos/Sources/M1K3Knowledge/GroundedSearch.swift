//  The one retrieval policy every search surface serves: with an embedder,
//  two-lane gated hybrid (documents + memories get separate top-K budgets,
//  GroundingGate floors both — ungated nearest-neighbour garbage was the
//  confabulation fuel); without one, FTS with the strict→relaxed retry.
//
//  Extracted from SearchKnowledgeTool so the MCP surface (which served
//  FTS-only even inside the app, where a live embedder sits in env) runs the
//  SAME policy as the agent tool. An empty result means "nothing cleared the
//  floor" — each caller phrases its own abstention.

//  test-pinned in KnowledgeMCPToolsTests, the in-app embedder wire is
//  verify-by-launch). Prior: Kev + claude-opus-4-8 (SearchKnowledgeTool).
