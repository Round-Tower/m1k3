//
//  The honest "Sources:" footer. Retrieval is promiscuous by design — top-K plus
//  a grounding-gate floor (0.51 at the time) lets an off-topic chunk ride above the bar (the
//  documented sourdough/Chain-of-Thought leak), and on an identity turn ("who are
//  you") the model answers from persona and cites nothing at all. Rendering the
//  footer from what was RETRIEVED therefore staples phantom sources onto answers
//  that never used them — a real honesty defect for a local-first assistant.
//
//  This keeps only the retrieved chunks the answer ACTUALLY cited: a validated
//  `[Title §heading]` marker (CitationValidator already computes that set and the
//  callers already throw it away). Source of truth = the model's validated
//  citations, not retrieval. An identity turn validly cites nothing → empty footer;
//  a grounded answer validly cites its doc → that source survives. The one trade:
//  a grounded answer that FORGETS its marker shows no footer — more honest than
//  inventing provenance, and the CHATEVAL `mustCite` fixtures are the regression
//  alarm if marker-emission ever gets flaky.
//
