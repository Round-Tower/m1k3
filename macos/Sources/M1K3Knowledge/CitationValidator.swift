//
//  Post-validates `[SOURCE §heading]` / `(SOURCE §heading)` citations in a model
//  response against what's actually indexed. Strips the ones the model invented
//  and reports them separately so an audit trail can record fabrication.
//
//  Generalised from the prior knowledge-server's CitationValidator: the existence check is *injected*
//  (a predicate) rather than hard-wired to the store, so the parsing/stripping
//  logic is pure and testable with no database. A store-backed predicate wires
//  in at the call site.
//
//  Both delimiters are accepted because Apple Foundation Models renders
//  citations as parentheticals `(ICH-Q7 §5.2 …)` in flowing prose even when the
//  prompt example uses brackets — and `[X]` reads to the model as a half-formed
//  markdown link. Accepting either keeps the audit honest without fighting style.
