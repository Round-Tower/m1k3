//
//  Relevance gate for retrieve-first grounding. Hybrid search always returns
//  top-K — even for "what model are you?" — so ungated injection pollutes
//  every prompt with whatever the store happens to hold, derailing small
//  reasoning models. The gate keeps a hit only when its vector similarity says
//  the query is actually about the store's content; when nothing is topical it
//  injects NOTHING and the model decides via the search_knowledge tool.
//
//  Gates on cosine similarity, NOT rrfScore: RRF is rank fusion — its scale
//  (~(0, 0.0167] per ranking) says how results order, never how relevant any
//  of them is in absolute terms.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-10, Confidence 0.8 (thresholds are
//  empirical starting points for bge-small — tune via the responder score
//  logs at ⌘R and update the constants). Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.9 — kind-aware
//  `relevant` (one order-preserving list for the explicit search floor) +
//  shared `clears` predicate; removed the dead public `filter` (kind-unaware,
//  zero production callers — a divergence trap beside `relevant`).
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.85 — chunkThreshold
//  0.62 → 0.68 from a live MCP gate-log measurement (off-domain noise ceiling
//  ~0.63, in-domain floor 0.736; the old 0.62 sat in the noise and leaked a
//  CoT chunk as a "source" for a sourdough query). memoryThreshold left at
//  0.54 (MEMEVAL-governed overlap). verify-at-⌘R on the live MCP loop.
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-14, Confidence 0.85 — both bge-era
//  provisionals RE-TUNED from on-device ABSEP + MEMEVAL on the new
//  qwen3-embed-512: chunkThreshold 0.68 → 0.51 (dead-zone [0.315, 0.697]
//  centre, separation doubled vs bge), memoryThreshold 0.54 → 0.39 (recall-
//  first now that qwen3 dropped the negative ceiling 0.556 → 0.422). See the
//  per-constant comments for the measured distributions. verify-at-⌘R.
