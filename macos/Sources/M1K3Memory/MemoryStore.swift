//  MemoryStore.swift
//  M1K3Memory
//
//  Memory as a first-class store, SEPARATE from the RAG document corpus.
//  Today `remember` ingests through DocumentIngester into KnowledgeStore —
//  i.e. a memory IS a document. This store splits them, because the two have
//  different physics:
//
//    RAG docs (KnowledgeStore)          Memories (this store)
//    ─────────────────────────          ─────────────────────
//    big, chunked, immutable            small, atomic, single-row
//    ingested wholesale                 written one fact at a time
//    deleted per-document               deleted per-fact (consent surface)
//    no relations between chunks        edges between memories matter
//    cited via § tokens                 surfaced as "you told me…"
//    relevance is the only signal       recency + supersession also signal
//
//  This is the temporal memory GRAPH: atomic facts (nodes) + typed edges +
//  supersession-over-time, traversed by a recursive CTE. It is the artifact a
//  later persona/"knows-me" LoRA distils — facts stay here (queryable, editable,
//  deletable), the *shape* of how they relate over time is what a prior learns.
//
//  DESIGN DECISIONS (vs the generic advice):
//
//  1. NO sqlite-vec, NO extension loading, NO SQLCipher build change.
//     The house pattern (KnowledgeStore.swift) is already BLOB embedding
//     columns + brute-force cosine in Swift + RRF hybrid — proven on-device,
//     zero dependencies, and fine to ~10k rows. A lifetime of atomic personal
//     memories is thousands of rows, not millions. Revisit only if recall
//     latency shows up in TTFT logs.
//
//  2. NO graph database. Edges are a table; traversal is a recursive CTE,
//     which SQLite runs natively and GRDB passes through untouched.
//
//  3. Memories are SINGLE-ROW — no chunking. A memory is an atomic fact
//     ("Kev's sister is Aoife", "decided RRF over learned fusion on 06-11").
//     If text arrives too big to be one fact, that's an ingest-policy problem
//     (summarise or split at write time), not a storage problem. This is what
//     makes per-row deletion an honest consent surface.
//
//  4. Same EmbedderReindexPolicy doctrine as KnowledgeStore: vectors carry an
//     embedder fingerprint in a meta table; kernel bump → one-time re-index.
//
//  5. Retrieval cutoff: reuse GroundingGate.memoryThreshold (0.35 since the
//     2026-07-09 instructed-query re-derivation; 0.39 before) — memories
//     are atomic facts, and query→short-fact cosines sit lower in the cone
//     than query→chunk (the MEMEVAL rationale on that constant). Was
//     chunkThreshold (0.51) until 2026-07-08; the stricter chunk bar silently
//     dropped the identity-fact class the corpus memory lane already recalls.
//     FTS-only hits still must NOT bypass the bar when recall is implicit —
//     the exact leak GroundingGate.filter fixed; only the bar moved.
//     NOTE (07-09 title composition): only the VECTOR lane gets the B5
//     title rescue — memory_fts indexes fact text alone (matching
//     knowledge_chunk_fts, which never indexes item titles either), so a
//     keyword whose only match is the title rides the vector lane.
//
//  6. SEPARATE DATABASE FILE (memory.sqlite), not new tables in knowledge.db.
//     Different lifecycle (sync/export/forget-all), different consent story,
//     and CloudKit row-wise sync later wants a clean record boundary.
//
//  iOS NOTE: this file works unchanged on iOS — GRDB, FTS5, recursive CTEs,
//  BLOB cosine all ship in the system SQLite. The only platform delta is where
//  embeddings come from and the Data Protection class on the file.
//
//  ── Review ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  Graduated from scratch/memory-store-sketch into a real, tested target. The
//  design is Fable's; this pass added the test contract (M1K3MemoryTests) that
//  pins recall-cutoff, supersession-over-time, undirected traversal, and the
//  forget consent cascade, and wired the M1K3Memory target into Package.swift.
//  Logic is unchanged from the sketch except where a test demanded a guarantee
//  the sketch only implied. The duplicated `sanitizeFTSQuery` is carried as a
//  documented follow-up: lift it (and KnowledgeStore's twin) into one shared
//  home in M1K3Knowledge rather than widen this feature PR's blast radius.
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-16, Confidence 0.88 (idioms proven in
//  KnowledgeStore; graph + supersession now TDD'd green; live remember-path
//  migration deliberately deferred to its own PR). Prior: Kev + claude-fable-5
//  (scratch/memory-store-sketch/MemoryStore.swift) → Kev + claude-opus-4-8
//  (KnowledgeStore.swift).
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-02 — executed the documented follow-up:
//  the duplicated sanitiser is lifted into M1K3Knowledge.FTSQuery (shared with
//  KnowledgeStore), and recallFTS gained the strict→relaxed zero-hit retry (B5)
//  its twin already had. The cosine floor in `recall` still gates relaxed hits.
