//
//  Live dictation via Apple's SFSpeechRecognizer + AVAudioEngine — system
//  frameworks, zero third-party dep, so this ships the speak→transcript→RAG loop
//  without a model download. On-device recognition is *required* (not just
//  preferred): M1K3 is on-device-only, so if the recogniser can't run offline we
//  report unavailable rather than silently sending audio to Apple's servers.
//
//  Yields the recogniser's *cumulative* best transcription per partial (matching
//  TranscriptAccumulator's "latest text wins" fold), then a final segment. The
//  whole class is verify-by-launch (needs a mic + Speech authorization), like
//  AVSpeechProvider — the pure pieces it feeds (segment, router, accumulator) are
//  unit-tested.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-06, Confidence 0.7,
//  Prior: internal call-pipeline project, AppleSpeechTranscriber + LiveTranscriptionSession
//  (Kev) — collapsed to one live-session provider, cumulative text, on-device
//  forced, device-picker + call-domain fields dropped.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-16 (concurrency deep pass, findings
//  1/6/14/16) — sessions are now GENERATION-stamped. Three races closed:
//  (a) a stale recognition callback (cancel-error or late isFinal from a
//  superseded session) used to run stopListening against CURRENT state and
//  silently kill the fresh session; (b) a stop landing while begin() sat in the
//  TCC-authorization suspension let begin re-arm the engine afterwards — mic
//  hot after stop, no teardown path (the audit's worst voice finding); (c) a
//  consumer cancelling the stream (instead of pairing stopListening) leaked the
//  live mic. Now: start/stop each bump `generation` under `lock`;
//  stopListening(ifGeneration:) claims state atomically and stale callers
//  no-op; begin() re-checks liveness after every suspension and runs a
//  commit-point epilogue after engine.start(); onTermination(.cancelled) makes
//  consumer-cancel teardown structural. Verify-by-launch per this file's
//  convention (TCC dialog + real mic); the pure pieces stay unit-tested.
