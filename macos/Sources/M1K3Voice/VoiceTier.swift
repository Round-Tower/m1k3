//  VoiceTier.swift
//  M1K3Voice
//
//  How M1K3 sounds when it speaks — the TTS analogue of BrainTier. Built-in is the
//  instant, zero-download Apple voice; M1K3 Voice is the richer neural voice
//  (Kokoro) that downloads once and then runs fully on-device. Drives the
//  onboarding voice-output card and the Settings picker.
//
//  Pure data: SF Symbol names are plain strings, no SwiftUI dependency, so this
//  stays testable in the package.
