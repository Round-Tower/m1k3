//
//  ConstellationView.swift
//  M1K3MemoryViz
//
//  The 3D memory constellation: motes for memories, threads for edges, accreting
//  as the store grows. A thin RealityKit adapter over the pure ConstellationModel
//  — all the layout/colour/geometry decisions are made (and tested) upstream;
//  this file just places entities and animates the growth. VERIFY-BY-RUN: there
//  are no unit tests for RealityView (the tested surface is ConstellationLayout +
//  ConstellationGeometry + ConstellationPalette); the visual feel is Kev's eye.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-16, Confidence 0.7 (compiles against
//  the RealityKit SPM target like M1K3Avatar; on-device look + the growth timing
//  are the named verify-owed). Prior: M1K3Avatar RealityKit views.
