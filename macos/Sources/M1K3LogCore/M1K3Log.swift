//
//  M1K3Log.swift
//  M1K3LogCore
//
//  The single source of truth for unified logging across EVERY M1K3 module.
//
//  Watch a whole session live:
//
//      log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "app.m1k3"' --level debug
//
//  (or filter the subsystem in Console.app). Content is logged as bounded,
//  single-line PREVIEWS, deliberately `.public` so Kev can diagnose his own
//  machine — these logs never leave the device, same trust boundary as the
//  knowledge store itself. Drop to `.private` before any telemetry ever exists
//  (it shouldn't).
//
//  WHY ITS OWN TARGET: this used to live in `M1K3Agent`, which depends on
//  `M1K3Inference` + `M1K3LanguageModel`. The heavy seam targets (M1K3MLX,
//  M1K3Kokoro, M1K3WhisperKit, M1K3Voice, …) can't import M1K3Agent just for a
//  logging constant without dragging the agent stack into their build. So the
//  subsystem constant + the category CATALOG live here, dependency-free, and
//  every target can reference them. This is what makes the `SubsystemGuard`
//  test enforceable: one allowed subsystem, one catalogue of categories, no
//  scattered string literals to drift (a Kokoro logger on "dev.m1k3.kokoro"
//  was silently dropped from issue reports for weeks — never again).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-30, Confidence 0.9 (pure + TDD-pinned;
//  the catalogue + guard are the durable drift-prevention layer). Prior: Kev +
//  claude-fable-5 (the original AgentLog M1K3Log/LogPreview, 2026-06-10).
