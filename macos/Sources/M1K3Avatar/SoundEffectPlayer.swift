//  Plays the UI earcons, behind two gates: the user's on/off preference and
//  "is M1K3 talking right now" (an earcon must never step on the voice). The
//  POLICY is a pure, fully-tested decision; the actual playback is an injected
//  sink — AVAudioPlayer in production (verify-by-launch), a recorder in tests.

//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-12, Confidence 0.85 (gate + dispatch
//  test-pinned; AVAudioPlayer pool is verify-at-⌘R). Prior: Unknown.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-02 — removed the unused
//  SoundEffectPlaying protocol (nothing in the repo typed against it; sink
//  injection is the test seam, and the app holds the concrete player).
