//  M1K3Avatar
//
//  The pure, reactive look of the companion's phosphor skin — colour + fresnel
//  power that the RealityKit surface shader (M1K3App/Phosphor.metal) reads via a
//  material custom_parameter. Mirrors GlyphTreatment / ChatBackdropTreatment: the
//  avatar responds to M1K3's state (calm green at rest, brighter while speaking,
//  cooler blue while it thinks) without the view owning any of that logic.
//
//  Value-only + packed into a SIMD4 so the render glue is a one-liner and the
//  decision is unit-tested off-device (the shader itself is verify-at-⌘R).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-17, Confidence 0.9 (per-activity mapping
//  + packing pinned by tests; the on-screen glow is verify-at-⌘R). Prior: Unknown.
