//  The measurement seam for anything that needs the REAL token cost of a
//  string through a provider's own tokenizer — not a chars≈tokens estimate.
//  Only tokenizer-backed backends (MLX) conform; Apple Foundation Models /
//  Mini have no exposed tokenizer and simply don't — callers reach this via
//  `provider as? TokenCounting`, and a nil cast is itself the correct answer
//  ("this turn's provider self-manages its context window, there is nothing
//  to measure or cap").
//
//  First consumer: `GroundingBudget` (M1K3Knowledge) caps the KNOWLEDGE +
//  memory grounding lanes AgentRAGResponder injects into the prompt, before
//  they can blow gemma-4's fixed non-history reserve (PR #65's prompt-size
//  instrument measured the grounded-Q worst case at 2998/3000 tokens — 2
//  tokens of headroom before `RotatingKVCache(8192)` silently rotates the
//  persona/grounding head out mid-turn). This protocol lives in M1K3Inference
//  — already an M1K3Chat dependency — rather than M1K3Chat casting to the
//  concrete `MLXGemmaProvider` type, which would need a new M1K3Chat→M1K3MLX
//  edge that doesn't otherwise exist.
