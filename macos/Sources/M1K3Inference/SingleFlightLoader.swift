//  SingleFlightLoader.swift
//  M1K3Inference
//
//  A single-flight async loader: concurrent callers share ONE in-flight load
//  instead of each kicking off their own. This replaces the check-then-act
//  NSLock MLXGemmaProvider used to cache its model container — that pattern read
//  the cache under the lock, released it, then ran the slow load with no lock
//  held, so two callers (a Settings preload racing the first generate) could both
//  pass the "not loaded yet" check and redundantly download the ~1GB container.
//
//  An actor serialises entry; the first caller starts the load and enrols as a
//  waiter before suspending, so every reentrant caller parks on the same flight.
//  On success the result is cached and returned instantly to later callers; on
//  failure the slot is cleared so a subsequent call retries rather than replaying
//  a stale error forever. Lives in the seam module (no Metal), so the concurrency
//  contract is proven under `swift test`, not stuck behind the MLX launch wall.

//  Review: claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-09 (PR #10) — cancelling a waiter now KEEPS the
//  slot so a later caller rejoins the still-in-flight load instead of starting a
//  duplicate download (only genuine failures clear the slot). Covered by a new test.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-16 (concurrency deep pass) — the PR #10
//  contract was aspirational: awaiting an unstructured Task's `.value` is NOT
//  cancellation-responsive for the waiter (proven by compiled probe — a cancelled
//  waiter blocked for the whole load, then received the value). Waiters now park
//  on per-caller continuations resumed by the flight's completion hook, wrapped in
//  withTaskCancellationHandler, so a cancelled waiter throws CancellationError
//  promptly while the flight keeps loading for everyone else. Also fixed: a load
//  that itself throws CancellationError now clears the slot (it used to be
//  mistaken for a waiter cancel and poisoned the loader with no retry path).
//  Both pinned red-first in SingleFlightLoaderTests.
