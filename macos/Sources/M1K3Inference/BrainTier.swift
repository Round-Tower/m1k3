//  M1K3Inference
//
//  The three brains the user chooses between at onboarding — Mini / Lil / Big
//  M1K3 — echoing the KMP app's tier concept (app/.../domain/ai/M1K3Tier.kt).
//  Mini is Apple Foundation Models (instant, on-device, no download); Lil and
//  Big are local MLX models that download once. Pure value type in the seam
//  module (no MLX import), so its metadata + the device recommendation + the
//  selection gate + persistence are `swift test`-able; AppEnvironment maps
//  `.backing` to a concrete provider.
//
//  Model mapping (2026-06-13, mlx-swift-lm 3.31.3): Lil = Qwen3.5-4B,
//  Big = Gemma-4-E4B (the gemma-3n-E4B successor). Huge = Qwen3.5-9B — the
//  intended gemma-4-12B uses a `gemma4_unified` arch that 3.31.3 cannot load
//  (probe-verified, Gate B); swap the id once upstream registers it.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-08, Confidence 0.8, Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-10 — Gemma 4 era: four tiers, new
//  RAM thresholds (Big is ~7GB at inference now → recommended floor 24GB),
//  Huge selectable at 32GB+, recommended at 48GB+.
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-13 — Lil 2B → 4B. The 2B-4bit was
//  below the floor for grounded generation + tool use (ignored good sources,
//  confabulated on an empty gate); 4B is the same Qwen3.5 family so tool-call
//  format (xmlFunction) + pre-open-think resolve unchanged. ~3GB, still fits 16GB.
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-30 — added approximateContextTokens +
//  usesRotatingKVCache (the long-context work). big=8192 is the HARD gemma-4
//  RotatingKVCache window (past it the persona/grounding head silently rotates
//  out); lil/huge=32768 unbounded KVCacheSimple. HistoryBudgetPolicy clamps the
//  conversation replay below the rotating window. Token counts are estimates —
//  on-device SelfTest verify-owed (the [SPIKE]); the gemma cliff is code-grounded.
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-22 — Lil/Huge moved OFF Qwen3.5 to
//  DENSE Qwen3 (Qwen3-4B-4bit / Qwen3-8B-4bit). Qwen3.5 is a GatedDeltaNet
//  hybrid whose per-timestep recurrent scan CPU-spikes on mlx-swift-lm 3.31.3.
//  NOTE: the Qwen3.5 mapping/claims ABOVE are now historical — dense Qwen3 routes
//  to .json tools (NOT xmlFunction) and does NOT pre-open <think> (verified vs the
//  real Qwen3 template); quantized KV stays safe (attentionWithCacheUpdate path).
//  See macos/docs/MODEL_CHOICES.md.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-02 — HUGE RETIRED (the all-gemma
//  reshuffle, step 1). Qwen3-8B was the weakest tool-caller and nobody's
//  favourite at anything; gemma-4 native tool-calling is Kev-verified live on
//  3.31.4. Three tiers again. A persisted "huge" migrates to .big via
//  `init(persisted:)` — never a silent Mini downgrade. The memory-floor /
//  isSelectable seam is KEPT (returns nil today): gemma-4-12B takes the Big
//  slot with a floor once upstream fixes RotatingKVCache.temporalOrder.
