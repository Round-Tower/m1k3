//
//  The background brain-upgrade state machine — pure, so every race the app
//  coordinator can hit has a deterministic, tested answer. The coordinator
//  (AppEnvironment+BrainUpgrade) owns the side effects: it evaluates
//  `OfferEligibility` with live inputs, runs the actual download, checks
//  `SwapSafety` before calling `selectBrain(.lil)`, and persists exactly one
//  thing — the dismissal flag. State itself is NEVER persisted: `recomputed`
//  rebuilds it from disk facts at launch (and after any external brain change),
//  so a bad state self-heals next run.
//
//  Consent model (invitation-first — the repo's signed promise is "downloads
//  only when you ask"): no fetch starts without `userAccepted` on the offer,
//  and only a CONSENTED staged state may hot-swap. Lil found already on disk
//  at launch stages UNconsented: it offers a one-tap switch, it never swaps a
//  brain the user didn't ask for this session.
