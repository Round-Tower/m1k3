//
//  The one-screen onboarding's brain decision. Mini-first is the product call
//  (time-to-first-whoa: talking in seconds beats a download bar) — but Mini is
//  Apple Foundation Models, and its availability has three flavours that
//  deserve three different answers. Pure so the whole table is `swift test`-able;
//  HelloView supplies the live `AFMAvailability` and acts on the outcome.
//
//  Invariants:
//    · a re-run never silently switches a non-Mini brain (Settings promises
//      "your brain is kept")
//    · `.notReady` is a transient asset sync — wait for Mini, never answer it
//      with a 2.3GB download
//    · only a genuinely blocked AFM falls back to the Lil download; the
//      user-fixable flavour (Apple Intelligence switched off) also offers the
//      OS-settings fix alongside.
