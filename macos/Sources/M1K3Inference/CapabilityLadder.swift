//  The push toward what we built — Mini-first gets a stranger talking in
//  seconds, but the product mustn't strand them there. Three pure decisions
//  that turn the one-shot upgrade nudge into a ladder:
//
//    · UpgradeTarget — the next rung for THIS Mac. Mini offers the
//      recommended tier directly (one right download, not two), Lil offers
//      Big only where Big is comfortable, Big is the top.
//    · StrugglePolicy — the small brain visibly hitting its ceiling. Pressure
//      must track REALITY: a re-offer earned by a felt limitation reads as
//      care; a re-offer on a timer reads as growth-hacking. There is no
//      timer input here by design.
//    · DismissalParkPolicy — "Maybe later" parks the offer until enough
//      struggles accumulate; three dismissals is an answer, permanently.
//
//  The coordinator persists two integers (dismissals, struggles-since) and
//  feeds them here; BrainUpgradePolicy's machine is unchanged — the park
//  decision arrives through its existing `dismissed` recompute input.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-03, Confidence 0.85 (thresholds are
//  product taste — tunable constants, pinned by tests; the shape is the
//  decision). Prior: none (new file).
