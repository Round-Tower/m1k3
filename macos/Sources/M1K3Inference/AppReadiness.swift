//  The global "is M1K3 usable yet" signal. Until the active brain's model is
//  actually loaded into memory, the chat surface should gate input — otherwise a
//  turn fires against a backend whose weights are still downloading, which is the
//  source of the "interacted before ready" latent bugs.
//
//  The subtlety this encodes: a weight-backed brain (MLX) reports `isAvailable ==
//  true` by construction ("this backend CAN serve on this Mac"), which is NOT the
//  same as "weights are present and warm". So readiness for a weight-backed brain
//  hangs on the ModelLoadState reaching `.ready`, while an instant backend (Apple
//  Foundation Models, no download) is ready the moment the system reports it
//  available. Pure + Sendable so the app can derive the gate without importing MLX.
