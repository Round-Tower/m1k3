//
//  ChatEvalFixture.swift
//  M1K3Eval
//
//  The fixture set for the chat-quality evals (M1K3_SELFTEST_CHATEVAL). Each
//  brain in the catalogue (Mini/Lil/Big/Huge) is run against these and scored,
//  so the routing policy stops being by-feel and becomes data-driven: the
//  AFM-vs-floor gap Kev hit by hand, proven with numbers.
//
//  Fixtures are PURE inline data (no Bundle, no I/O) — the same shape as
//  MemoryEvalFixtures/SeparationEvalFixtures. Each carries an Expectation that
//  the deterministic ChatEvalScorer applies; nothing here runs a model.
//
//  Six task-kinds, ~5-8 each: open-chat (persona/coherence), grounded-Q
//  (cite a seeded doc), reasoning (multi-step), code-gen (PRODUCE an artifact),
//  tool-use (calls the right tool), refusal (declines the unsafe ask). Extend a
//  kind as real misses surface — the runner picks up new fixtures with zero wiring.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-14, Confidence 0.85 (fixture set is
//  hand-curated, deliberately small — the value is in the heuristics being
//  honest, not in coverage breadth; grow it from real on-device misses).
//  Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-29, Confidence 0.85 — added the code-gen
//  kind. The eval rewarded refusal on 12 unsafe fixtures but never measured the
//  COST of over-refusal on a benign generate-this ask, so the "refuses to code"
//  regression scored 100% and shipped unseen. These five close that blind spot.
