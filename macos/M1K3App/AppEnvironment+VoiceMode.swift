//
//  AppEnvironment+VoiceMode.swift
//  M1K3
//
//  Voice-first mode's adapter: builds the VoiceLoopController against the
//  app's existing seams. `runTurn` wraps `chat.send` DIRECTLY (not env.send —
//  its idle-reset would fight the loop's avatar ownership) and reads the
//  answer off `chat.messages.last`. The mic closure caches the provider
//  instance it started (mirroring `dictationProvider`) so stop hits the same
//  engine. While the mode is active, the in-mode brain toggle replaces the
//  global Reasoning setting entirely — off (default) forces fast even over an
//  explicit Always, on yields auto (see VoiceThinkingPolicy).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-06-11, Confidence 0.8 (adapter glue over
//  test-pinned loop + seams; verify-at-⌘R for the full beat). Prior: Unknown.
