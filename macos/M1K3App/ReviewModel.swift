//  ReviewModel.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  The shared state behind the review panel, owned by AppEnvironment so every
//  surface that wants to surface a link or file converges here: the inspector
//  itself, a one-click chip in the chat transcript, the MCP `open_link` tool a
//  visiting agent calls, and M1K3's own local agent mid-answer. One observable,
//  one source of truth.
//
//  Holds the security-scoped grant for a file target and releases it when we move
//  off — so the sandbox access doesn't leak across opens.
