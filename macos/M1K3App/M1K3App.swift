//  Review: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-17, Confidence 0.85 — moved AppEnvironment
//  ownership from the main-window `.task` to AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching
//  (built + registered + warmed at launch, window-independent), so a background App
//  Intent launch can reach the warm model with no window. AppDelegate is now
//  @MainActor + ObservableObject and publishes `environment`/`startupError`; the
//  Scene reads `appDelegate.environment`. Self-test path unchanged (guarded).
