//
//  PixelFont.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  M1K3's bundled type faces, registered at launch via CoreText so `Font.custom`
//  resolves them regardless of where the bundler drops the files in Resources:
//    • Silkscreen (OFL) — the pixel accent face for wordmark / accent moments.
//    • OpenDyslexic (OFL) — the optional "Dyslexia-friendly" reading mode.
//  Call sites are `Font.pixel(_:)` and `Font.dyslexic(_:)`.
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-08, Confidence 0.8, Prior: Unknown
//  Review: Kev + claude-sonnet-4-6, 2026-06-08 — generalised the single-font
//  registrar into BundledFonts (Silkscreen + OpenDyslexic) for the reading modes.
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-02, Confidence 0.85 — added Font.pixelTitle
//  (the shared 15pt title accent) and codified the house rules (12pt floor, no
//  dynamic user content, wordmark kerning) from the brand-typography sweep.
