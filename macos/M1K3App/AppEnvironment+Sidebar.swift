//
//  AppEnvironment+Sidebar.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  The leading sidebar's navigation model. `SidebarSelection` is what the
//  sidebar List binds its selection to and ContentView's detail switch reads;
//  `.conversation(id)` is a TRANSIENT pick (ContentView's onChange switches
//  the conversation and immediately snaps selection back to `.chat` — tapping
//  a past conversation should show it, not leave you staring at a picker).
//
//  Deliberately local @State in ContentView, NOT promoted to AppEnvironment
//  (unlike env.review.isPresented): nothing outside the view tree needs to
//  drive which sidebar destination is showing today. Only the sidebar's
//  VISIBILITY persists (mirrors AppEnvironment+Avatar.swift's avatarDisplayKey
//  shape) — the selection itself resets to .chat every launch, matching the
//  app's existing "chat is the front door" convention.
