//
//  ConstellationWindow.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  The window + menu command that open the 3D memory constellation. Pulls the
//  live graph from the store (allMemories + allEdges), builds the pure
//  ConstellationModel, and hands it to the RealityKit ConstellationView. The
//  layout/colour/geometry are all tested upstream in M1K3Memory / M1K3MemoryViz;
//  this is app glue (verify-by-run, like the other windows).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-16, Confidence 0.75 (compiles against
//  the viz target; the live look + the "grows over time" feel are Kev's ⌘R).
//  Prior: Unknown.
