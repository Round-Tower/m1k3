//  MenuBarAsk.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  Powers the menu-bar "Ask M1K3" box: one grounded answer with no chat window
//  and no transcript. Deliberately mirrors MCPHostController.askBrain — a
//  DEDICATED responder (never the chat one; collectedSources() is a draining
//  read), a single-flight guard, a 120s deadline so a runaway generation can't
//  wedge the bar, and the shared canary tripwire. The pure mapping lives in
//  M1K3Chat's MenuBarAskDriver; this is the @MainActor glue (verify-by-launch).
