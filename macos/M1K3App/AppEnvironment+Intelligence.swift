//
//  AppEnvironment+Intelligence.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  The shared intelligence surface — ask / speak / remember — used by BOTH the
//  in-process MCP server (MCPHostController) AND the macOS App Intents
//  (Ask · Speak · Remember). One implementation, N adapters: the single-flight
//  guard, the 120s ask deadline, the shared canary tripwire, the memory-graph
//  dual-write all live here once, so a Siri/Shortcuts ask gets the exact same
//  protections a visiting agent's `ask_m1k3` does.
//
//  App-glue (verify-by-launch): the tested core is HeadlessAsk (M1K3Chat) +
//  IntentInput (M1K3Chat) + the package seams this assembles. The registry below
//  also gives an App Intent's perform() — which runs outside SwiftUI's
//  @Environment — a way to reach the live, warm environment.
