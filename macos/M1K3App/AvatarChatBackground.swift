//  AvatarChatBackground.swift
//  M1K3App
//
//  The avatar (constellation / companion creature / pixel face) as a full-window
//  background behind the chat — opt-in, and REACTIVE: it blooms when M1K3 is idle
//  or speaking, and recedes (dims, blurs, scales back) while you read a streaming
//  answer or type, so the conversation always stays legible. Reuses AvatarSurface
//  (the same 3-way dispatch the avatar panel + voice hero use), so it inherits the
//  user's chosen companion for free; the reactive decision is the pure, TDD'd
//  ChatBackdropTreatment. Mirrors AudioCaptureBackdrop: a gated, reduce-motion-
//  aware, non-interactive layer over the glass.

//  Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-17, Confidence 0.75 (treatment TDD'd;
//  the full-bleed look, legibility over the glass bubbles, and the bloom/recede
//  feel are verify-by-eye at ⌘R). Prior: Unknown.
