//  M1K3App
//
//  Coordinator for the invitation-first background brain upgrade — now the
//  CAPABILITY LADDER: the offer targets the next rung for THIS Mac
//  (UpgradeTarget: mini → the recommended tier, lil → Big where comfortable),
//  and a "Maybe later" parks the offer instead of burying it — it re-arms
//  only when the small brain visibly struggles (StrugglePolicy: failed turn,
//  long-form ask on Mini, capped-out generation), and three dismissals is a
//  permanent answer (DismissalParkPolicy). Pressure tracks reality, never a
//  timer. All decisions live in the PURE, tested layer (BrainUpgradePolicy /
//  OfferEligibility / SwapSafety / CapabilityLadder, M1K3Inference); this
//  file only gathers live inputs and runs side effects.
//
//  The hard rules, enforced here:
//    · the fetch NEVER touches `modelLoad` or the live provider — it's a
//      disk-only BrainWeightsFetcher snapshot; the readiness gate must not
//      hide a working chat behind an invisible download
//    · no download without the user's tap on the nudge (the repo's signed
//      promise: "downloads only when you ask")
//    · the hot-swap fires only between turns with everything idle
//      (SwapSafety), through the ordinary `selectBrain(.lil)` path
//    · `selectBrain`/the picker route cancel the fetch synchronously first —
//      one writer to the Hub cache; the partial snapshot resumes elsewhere
//    · a fetch "success" is only believed after `isBrainDownloaded` confirms
//      weights on disk (the downloader falls back to a local partial on
//      offline/auth instead of throwing).
//
//  Signed: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-03, Confidence 0.8 (side-effect glue
//  over 25 pinned transitions; download/swap behaviour is verify-by-launch —
//  named: nudge beat, Settings %, kill-mid-download resume, swap-at-idle toast).
//  Prior: none (new file).
//  Review: Kev + claude-fable-5, 2026-07-03 (capability ladder) — Kev's call:
//  "we've built capabilities, we need to push people towards them." One-shot
//  terminal dismissal → struggle-earned re-offers; hardcoded Lil → the
//  UpgradeTarget rung (Big offered directly on 24GB+ Macs). Two persisted
//  ints replace the dismissal bool; the state machine is unchanged — the park
//  decision arrives through its existing recompute input.
