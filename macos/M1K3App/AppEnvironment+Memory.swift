//  Thin accessors that turn the flat Memories list into an explorable graph
//  surface. Every method is a best-effort wrapper over the TESTED MemoryStore
//  graph APIs (allMemories / related / recall / forget) — the surface reads the
//  GRAPH (ids + edges + provenance), not the corpus twin the old list rendered.
//
//  Forget here honours the same "no residue" promise as the MCP forget path
//  (MCPHostController.memoryToolDefinitions): the graph forget cascades the
//  fact's vector + edges, and we chase the dual-written corpus twin by the same
//  content-identity `source_ref` so search_knowledge/ask can't keep a ghost.
