//
// M1K3 — Mac-native MVP.
// Multi-module Swift package consumed by the SwiftUI app shell (added at the UI
// phase). Business logic lives here so `swift test` drives the TDD loop without
// the Xcode/simulator storm — same split as the prior knowledge-server project's the internal knowledge-server core.
//
// Target platform is macOS 26 (Tahoe): SwiftUI Liquid Glass + on-device
// Foundation Models. Heavy deps (MLX, GRDB, WhisperKit, swift-sdk) are added
// per-phase as the modules that need them land, to keep early builds quick.
//
// Signed: Kev + claude-opus-4-8, 2026-06-06, Confidence 0.8, Prior: Unknown
// Context: First Mac-native surface for M1K3. Scaffold begins with the pure,
// dependency-free knowledge primitives (VectorMath, RRFFusion) ported from
// the prior knowledge-server project so the foundation builds in seconds before MLX/GRDB enter the graph.
