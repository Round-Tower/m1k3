# M1K3 macOS — distribution automation

Three tools, each doing only what it's best at (the prior knowledge-server's proven split):

| Job | Tool | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Build / sign / **notarize** (direct DMG + App Store .pkg) | **bash** | `../tools/release/release-macos.sh`, `release-mas.sh` |
| **Test + TestFlight + App Store binary** | **Xcode Cloud** | `../ci_scripts/` + a workflow in App Store Connect |
| **ASO: metadata + screenshots + TestFlight notes** | **Fastlane** (metadata-only) | this folder |
| PR tests | GitHub Actions | `../../.github/workflows/` (already there) |

## Fastlane (metadata-only)

```bash
cd macos
bundle install                      # one-time
bundle exec fastlane mac metadata       # push name/subtitle/keywords/description
bundle exec fastlane mac screenshots    # push screenshots_mac/
bundle exec fastlane mac deliver_all    # both
bundle exec fastlane mac beta_metadata  # update TestFlight "What to Test"
```

ASO copy is version-controlled in `metadata_mac/en-US/`. **The keyword field
(`keywords.txt`) is the real ASO lever** — edit it freely; it's invisible to
users and re-uploadable any time (unlike the bundle ID, which is neither).

Auth: `apple_id` (Appfile) → interactive/session login. For CI, set an App Store
Connect API key (`APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH/_KEY_ID/_ISSUER_ID`) and
Fastlane uses it automatically — no 2FA prompts.

## Xcode Cloud

The `ci_scripts/` sit next to `M1K3.xcodeproj` so Xcode Cloud finds them.
`ci_post_clone.sh` runs **`xcodegen generate` first** — M1K3's pbxproj is
gitignored, so without it Xcode Cloud has no project to build (the one real
difference from the prior knowledge-server, which commits its pbxproj).

To turn it on: App Store Connect → your app → **Xcode Cloud** → create a workflow,
point it at this repo, scheme **M1K3**. Suggested:
- **Test** workflow on pull requests (runs the M1K3 suite).
- **Beta** workflow on `master`/tags → Archive → **TestFlight** (distributed natively).

Direct notarized DMGs are *not* an Xcode Cloud thing — those stay in
`tools/release/release-macos.sh` (run locally or from GitHub Actions on a tag).
